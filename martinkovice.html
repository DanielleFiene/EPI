                <h2>Property Overview</h2>
                <p>Are you looking for a romantic, spacious estate for business purposes or to accommodate a large family? This exceptional property, originally built in 1877, has been meticulously renovated between 2006 and 2007 to preserve its historical charm while offering modern comforts.</p>
            
                <p>The estate has recently been rented out for larger groups and travel agencies, making it an ideal investment for hosting weddings or other events. The total built-up area and courtyard span 1,804 m², with buildings covering approximately one-third of the plot. The remaining space features a landscaped courtyard with greenery, a swimming pool, a terrace, and an outdoor horse stable.</p>
            
                <p>Additionally, the property includes surrounding plots totaling 8,217 m², providing both privacy and expansion opportunities. The courtyard boasts a covered swimming pool with a depth of 1.6 meters. The residential area is seamlessly connected with the utility sections, including original farm structures. Across the courtyard, a large barn with a new roof serves as a garage, storage for equipment, and two horse stables. The estate also features a combination of wooden and brick ceilings, adding to its rustic charm.</p>
            
                <p>Situated in one of the most beautiful natural regions of the Czech Republic, in the northeastern part of Bohemia, the estate is nestled in the picturesque village of Martínkovice. It offers a peaceful and serene environment, making it perfect for relaxation or investment. With slight modifications, it could be adapted for dual living, ensuring flexibility and comfort.</p>
            
                <p>The complex includes a main building of approximately 30 meters by 11 meters with basements, a detached barn of approximately 25 meters by 10 meters, a storage space of approximately 5 meters by 7 meters, and a detached outdoor building of approximately 10 meters by 8 meters. The indoor swimming pool measures approximately 10.5 meters by 5 meters, with an average depth of around 1.6 meters.</p>
            
                <p>The mansion features two floors with a total living area of approximately 600 m². The layout includes 5 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, a storage room, a living room, a dining room, a large recreation room, and a heating room. The detached barn contains 2 horse stables, and there is ample outdoor space to accommodate additional horses. The outdoor building serves as an excellent space for relaxation or hosting events.</p>
            
                <p>The estate is arranged in a quadrangle shape, enclosed by a wrought-iron gate, ensuring privacy and security. The climate is slightly warmer in summer compared to the Netherlands and somewhat colder in the winter.</p>
            
                <p>Additionally, in the Czech Republic, pension income up to approximately €29.000 per person is exempt from income tax. Property taxes are nearly nonexistent, and vehicle taxes are either very low or do not apply.</p>
